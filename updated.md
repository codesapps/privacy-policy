### 1. Introduction

Thanks for choosing Code S!

At Code S, we want to give you the best possible experience to ensure that you enjoy our service today, tomorrow, and in the future. To do this we will request to understand your habits so we can deliver an exceptional and personalized service specifically for you. That said, your privacy and the security of your personal data is, and will always be, enormously important to us. So, we want to transparently explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your personal data - as well as outline the controls and choices you have around when and how you choose to share your personal data.

That is our objective, and this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) will explain exactly what we mean in further detail below.

### 2. About this Policy
This Policy sets out the essential details relating to your personal data relationship with Code S. The policy applies to all Code S applications and any associated services (referred to as ‘Code S Apps’, ‘CodeSApps’, ‘Code S LLC’, 'Xtract Studios', 'Xtract Apps'). The terms governing your use of the Code S Service are defined in our Terms and Conditions of Use (the “Terms and Conditions of Use”).

From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional applications or services. If the introduction of these new or additional services results in any change to the way we collect or process your personal data we will provide you with more information and additional terms or policies. Unless stated otherwise when we introduce these new or additional services, they will be subject to this Policy.

The aim of this Policy is to:

Ensure that you understand what personal data we collect about you, the reasons why we collect and use it, and who we share it with;
Explain the way we use the personal data that you share with us in order to give you a great experience when you are using Code S applications and services; and
Explain your rights and choices in relation to the personal data we collect and process about you and how we will protect your privacy.
We hope this helps you to understand our privacy commitments to you. For further clarification of the terms used in this Policy please visit our Privacy Center on code-s.net. For information on how to contact us if you ever have any questions or concerns, please see the ‘How to Contact Us’ Section 14 below. Alternatively, if you do not agree with the content of this Policy, then please remember it is your choice whether you want to use Code S's applications or services.

### 3. Your rights and your preferences: Giving you choice and control
You may be aware that a new European Union law, called the General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR" gives certain rights to individuals in relation to their personal data. Accordingly, we have implemented additional transparency and access controls in our [Privacy Center](https://privacy.code-s.net/) to help users take advantage of those rights. As available and except as limited under applicable law, the rights afforded to individuals are:

* **Right of Access** - the right to be informed of and request access to the personal data we process about you;
* **Right to Rectification** - the right to request that we amend or update your personal data where it is inaccurate or incomplete;
* **Right to Erasure** - the right to request that we delete your personal data;
* **Right to Restrict** - the right to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing all or some of your personal data;
* **Right to Object** -
the right, at any time, to object to us processing your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation;
the right to object to your personal data being processed for direct marketing purposes;
* **Right to Data Portability** - the right to request a copy of your personal data in electronic format and the right to transmit that personal data for use in another party’s service; and
* **Right not to be subject to Automated Decision-making** - the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.
In order to enable you to exercise these rights with ease and to record your preferences in relation to how Code S uses your personal data, we provide you with access to the following settings via your Privacy Settings page:

**Privacy Settings** - allows you to control some of the categories of personal data we process about you, enables you to access your personal data via a ‘View my Data’ button, and includes a link to the [Privacy Center](https://privacy.code-s.net/) on code-s.net where you can find out more information about how Code S uses your personal data and what your rights are; and, manage your publicly available personal data, and set your sharing preferences.
The Privacy Center puts you in control of how Code S processes your personal data. It provides you with information about what happens if you adjust your settings on your Account Settings page and how to opt out of receiving certain messages from Code S. If we send you electronic marketing messages based on your consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may, at any time, respectively withdraw such consent or declare your objection (“opt-out”) at no cost.

You can find out more about the GDPR rights described above and the controls we provide to all Code S users with respect to these rights in the ‘Your Rights’ section contained in the Privacy Center. If you have any questions about your privacy, your rights, or how to exercise them, please contact our Data Protection Officer using the ‘Contact Us’ form on the Privacy Center. We will respond to your request within a reasonable period of time upon verification of your identity.

### 4. How do we collect your personal data?
